A comprehensive eye-tracking dataset combining **high-frame-rate periocular videos (120 fps)** and **high-frequency gaze data (240 Hz)** collected from 26 participants in VR to enable accurate, multimodal emotion recognition based on Ekman's seven basic emotions.

**Key Contributions:**
- First dataset with high-frame-rate periocular videos capturing micro-expressions in VR
- 4× higher frequency eye-tracking data compared to existing datasets
- Open-source Unity-based data collection and Label Studio annotation tools

> **Tongyun Yang**, Yidong Zhao, Qian Tao  
> *Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL), 2025*

Demonstrating that trained nnU-Net models contain substantial weight redundancy — **over 80% of weights can be removed** through simple magnitude-based pruning while maintaining a proxy Dice score of >0.95 across multiple medical segmentation tasks.

**Key Findings:**
- 80%+ weight reduction with minimal performance loss
- Applicable to both 2D and 3D nnU-Net configurations
- Critical weights concentrate near encoder/decoder ends; bottleneck layers can be heavily pruned
- Validated across four different medical image segmentation datasets
